# 💻⚙️ SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

## Welcome 👋  

This project is part of my professional portfolio and demonstrates how to build a scalable **ETL data pipeline, and analytical data model**, to turn raw operational data into actionable business intelligence. It mirrors real-world scenarios where clean, reliable data is the foundation for decision-making in sales, inventory, and customer analysis.

In this repository, you will find:
- End-to-End Workflow: From raw source tables to a dimensional data warehouse (Star Schema), and analytics‑ready structure.
- Practical SQL Expertise: Leveraging of complex joins, window functions, and performance-optimized queries.
- Business-Ready Analytics: Examples of queries designed to answer key business performance questions.

## My Background & Transition 👤
As a **Senior Statistician** at the Serbian National Statistical Institute, I collaborated daily with data engineers and software developers to design and implement ETL processes across domains such as agricultural statistics, national accounts, and time series forecasting to ensure data integrity and relevance. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge **analytics and engineering**, positioning me as a data analyst who understands the full data lifecycle. I am now transitioning my skills to the business sector, aiming to act as the crucial link between data infrastructure and strategic business insight as a Data Analyst.
