# 💻⚙️ SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

You are welcome to explore the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project🚀**.  

This project is part of my professional portfolio and demonstrates **industry‑recognized best practices in data analytics, supported by strong data engineering expertise**. It highlights my ability to deliver actionable insights while designing scalable architectures and ETL pipelines that ensure data quality and reliability.  

As a **Senior Statistician**, I collaborated daily with data engineers and software developers to design and implement ETL processes across domains such as agricultural statistics, national accounts, and time series forecasting at the Serbian National Statistical Institute. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge **analytics and engineering**, positioning me as a data analyst who understands the full data lifecycle.
