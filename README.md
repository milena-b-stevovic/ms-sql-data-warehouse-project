# 💻⚙️ SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

## Welcome 👋  

This project is part of my professional portfolio and demonstrates industry‑recognized best practices in **ETL pipelines, data modeling, and analytics**, showing how raw data can be transformed into business‑ready insights.

As a **Senior Statistician**, I collaborated daily with data engineers and software developers to design and implement ETL processes across domains such as agricultural statistics, national accounts, and time series forecasting at the Serbian National Statistical Institute. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge **analytics and engineering**, positioning me as a data analyst who understands the full data lifecycle.
